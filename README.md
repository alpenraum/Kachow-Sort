# Kachow-Sort

I'd like to welcome you to the 22nd century of sorting algorithms. As a fellow developer I know the struggle of having to decades for a sorting algorithm to do its job. That is why I committed my last months to researching and developing the perfect sorting algorithm. May I present to you: The **Kachow-Sort**. 

# Why choose Kachow-Sort?
I don't expect you to believe those praises. You might have to try it yourself and see the miracle of modern computing. But I also see that one bug you have fix right now, so I will make it easy for you. Why should you choose Kachow-Sort over the beautiful Implementation that is called *Collections.sort()*? 

 - O(1) - Do I have to say anything else?
 - Stability - This algorithm is as stable as the Chinese wall.
 - Ease of use / intuitivity - you have never worked with easier code 

# Technology behind it

By this point you might ask how this is even possible? We here at Kachow inc. spend a lot of time researching quantum computing and found a way to incorporate the speed of such operations into the common computer architecture. This has the advantage that you will have more time tackling the real problems of a software engineer (such as the coffee machine) while still being able to tell your project manager how productive you are.

Let's face it. We both know that those fancy words don't mean anything to you. You want a fast and simple solution for your problem. Well, you have found it.

# Planed updates and Enhancements
- support for more datastructures such as maps and trees
- implementing a blockchain variant (Who doesn't like blockchain?)

##known bugs
- in certain edge cases the algorithm may not be stable.
